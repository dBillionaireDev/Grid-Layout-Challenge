## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. HTML5:
   - I deepened my understanding of HTML5 by using semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`. These tags not only improved the structure of the project but also enhanced accessibility and SEO by providing meaningful content division.

2. Flexbox:
   - I mastered the power of Flexbox for flexible, responsive layouts. I learned how to align items both horizontally and vertically using properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction`. Flexbox made it much easier to manage layout adjustments across different screen sizes without relying on complex positioning techniques.

3. CSS Grid & Grid Placement:
   - I also mastered CSS Grid, which allowed me to create more complex layouts. I learned how to define grid structures using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`, and how to place elements within the grid using properties like `grid-column` and `grid-row`. This gave me fine control over positioning and layout across various screen sizes.

4. Positioning:
   - I explored different positioning techniques such as `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`. Understanding the positioning context of each element allowed me to achieve precise layouts and layer elements effectively without breaking the flow of the content.

5. Responsive Design:
   - Combining Flexbox and Grid with proper media queries, I created responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile views. This is a critical skill in modern web development, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.

6. Project Organization:
   - Using semantic HTML tags and mastering layout tools like Flexbox and Grid improved my ability to structure projects with cleaner, more maintainable code, enhancing both the user experience and development workflow.

### Continued development

Responsive and Accessible Design: Advance your skills in responsive layouts and web accessibility to ensure all users can access your projects.
Version Control: Improve your Git skills by practicing branching, merging, and collaboration.
Backend Development: Learn Node.js, Nest.js, and databases like MongoDB to build RESTful APIs and manage server-side logic.
TypeScript: Embrace TypeScript for stronger code reliability and type safety in larger projects.
Testing & Debugging: Master tools like Jest and DevTools for better testing and debugging.
Performance Optimization: Learn techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and image optimization.
Deployment: Understand deployment processes with Vercel, Netlify, and AWS, and get familiar with CI/CD pipelines.
